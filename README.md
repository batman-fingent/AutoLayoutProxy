# AutoLayoutProxy
AutoLayoutProxy is a convenient way for creating and constraining views. Avoid repetation of code wherever possible.

## Why use AutoLayoutProxy?

Have you ever had to write lines and lines of code to add subviews and anchor them like the following:
```swift
view.addSubview(subview)
subview.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false

subview.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.bottomAnchor).isActive = true
...
subview.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.trailingAnchor).isActive = true
```

Worry no more AutoLayoutProxy helps you with this situation as follows:
```swift
view.addSubview(subview) {
    subview.top      == view.bottom
    ...
    subview.trailing == view.trailing
}
// Or in short
view.addSubview(subview) {
    $0.sides == $1.sides
}
```

You see thats all thats required. Now, you might be wondering what would you do if you had to make a constraint with a relation that's not equal but, less than or greater than, like the following:
```swift
subview.leadingAnchor.constraint(lessThanOrEqualTo: view.leadingAnchor, constant: -8).isActive = true
subview.trailingAnchor.constraint(greaterThanOrEqualTo: view.trailingAnchor: constant: 16).isActive = true
```

AutoLayoutProxy let's you do this:
```swift
subview.leading  <= view.leading
subview.trailing >= view.trailing
```

In the case of constants you can add or substract them in the same expresion, so instead of this:
```swift
subview.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.bottomAnchor, constant: 16).isActive = true
subview.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.leadingAnchor, constant: -32).isActive = true
```

You only need this:
subview.top     == view.bottom + 16
subview.leading == view.trailing - 32
If you would like to get the constraint for animations or reference in future, just do:
```swift
let subviewTopConstraint      = subview.top == view.bottom + 16
subviewTopConstraint.constant = 32
```

If you don't want the constraints to not be active on the first go just do, '!=' or even '!<=' and '!>=', like the following:
```swift
subview.top      != view.bottom
subview.leading  !<= view.leading
subview.trailing !>= view.trailing
```

In case of dimensions like height or width:
```swift
subview.widthAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.widthAnchor, multiplier: 2, constant: 8).isActive = true
subview.heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 64).isActive = true
```
You only need this:
```swift
subview.width  == view.width * 2 + 8
subview.height == 64
```
For addSubview and translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false you could just write a closure as follows:
```swift
view.addSubview(subview) {
  subview.sides <= view.sides
}
```
You also have other helpers like sides that include all sides, and size which takes a CGSize and also both horizontal and vertical constraints and centers.
```swift
// Constraint all sides with a padding of 2
subview.sides == view.sides + 2
// Constraint both centers with offsets 4 and 8.
subview.centers == view.center + UIOffset(x: 4, y: 8)
// Constraint vertical(top and bottom) or horizontal(leading and trailing)
subview.vertical   == view.vertical
subview.horizontal == view.horizontal
// Constraint size either with CGSize or both sides 64
subview.size == CGSize(w: 8, h: 16)
subview.size == 64
```

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate AutoLayoutProxy into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '9.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'AutoLayoutProxy'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```
